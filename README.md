<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In this project, we create a Todo List app using Javascript. The users can create a project, and assign to it their tasks. The tasks can include title, description, date, and priority. 

We are using the knowledge acquired about: Objects, Factory Function, and  Module Patterns. Also, we implement the concepts of Single Responsibility and Tightly Coupled Objects.
